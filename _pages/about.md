Hi, and welcome to my personal site! 

I go by Advadnoun on Twitter but my given name is Ryan Murdock. 

Most of my recent work is in machine learning research and engineering, with a focus on text-to-image, where I've done foundational research along with working on large-scale text-to-image projects that you may have heard of. 
I also have interests & work within art, psychology, linguistics, vision, and others. 

Formerly affiliated with the University of Utah, my Patreon, & Adobe. 

Feel free to read a slice of my thoughts in the Blog Posts section above -- it's sparse right now, but follow with RSS or Twitter if you'd like :) 
I'm also planning on updating my Portfolio for art in the next while.
