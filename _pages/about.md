I go by Advadnoun on Twitter but my given name is Ryan Murdock. 

Most of my recent work is in Machine Learning Research and Engineering, with a focus on text-to-image systems, where I've done foundational research and worked on large-scale generative Machine Learning projects that you may have heard of. 


I'm also interested in & have worked in areas of art, psychology, linguistics, & visual search. 

Formerly affiliated with the University of Utah, my Patreon, & Adobe. 

Feel free to read a slice of my thoughts in the Blog Posts section above -- it's sparse right now, but follow with RSS or on Twitter if you'd like :) 
I'm also planning on updating my Portfolio for art in the next while.
